# Short-Projects

Concatenation function is to merge or stack the n number of images into rows and cols depending upon the user's input. The fuction takes two inputs, 'scale-value' and 'image-list'. The scale value resize the original image. Whereas, Image-list takes the list of the images. To put the images in one row, define all the images in that list. But if you want to display images into multiple rows and columns then put the images in nested list and pass it to the function. If, the length of each list element in the final list is not same, then a black image took place of the next element in the list having less number of elements and display the black image with other images of the row to show final image. 
Nested List gives the final image in matrix form, on the other hand list gives the final image in single row.
For Nested List, the lenght of the final list gives the number of rows, and maximum length of the list elements in the final list gives the number of columns.
